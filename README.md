# EconChallenge_03-2019

This was a group challenge which involved investigating the cause of the appreciation of USD relative to other currencies during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. It was an exercise in using pandas, matplotlib and statistics packages. 

For my contribution, one dataset used is FX_rates.csv, a copy of 'Foreign_Exchange_Rates.csv' which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/brunotly/foreign-exchange-rates-per-dollar-20002019. The other datasets were downloaded from https://data.oecd.org/interest/short-term-interest-rates.htm#indicator-chart. 

The team's final submission can be found at https://github.com/mwtb47/Team-Webb-Presentation.
